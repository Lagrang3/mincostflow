Min Cost Flow library
=====================

This is a proof of concept library for solving the Min Cost Flow (MCF) problem
for linear and convex costs functions.

The algorithms used here are taken from Ahuja, et. al book "Network Flows:
Theory, Algorithms and Applications", 1993.

The C-API is described [here](c-api.md).
